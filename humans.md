# Who's who on the Turing Way team

This file will give you a little introduction to the various members of the Turing Way development team.

### Kirstie Whitaker

**Who are you?**

I'm a research fellow at the Alan Turing Institute and a senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.
I have a PhD in Neuroscience from the University of California at Berkeley and conducted my postdoctoral research at the University of Cambridge in the Brain Mapping Unit.
I am a Mozilla fellowship (2016) and Fulbright scholarship (2007) alumna.

**What are you passionate about?**

I'm really passionate about the concept of making science "open for all".
I take that to mean we should share all of our outputs - the data, code and protocols that we develop - whether they're "significant" or not.
But it also includes making those outputs FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. I am an advocate for greater diversity in STEM and in data science and particularly passionate about improving the ways we reward collaborative and supportive working.
Finally, I'd like to pivot to having data science project be developed in the open from the beginning and with a decision making governance processs that is inclusive and community-lead.

**Why do you care about the Turing Way?**

I've done a lot of advocacy for changing research culture to make our work more efficient and effective, and I've noticed that we need to address the power structures in academia if we are to truly make research reproducible by default.
For example, if a PhD student's supervisor says to them on the very first day: I want you to use git for version control and to keep your data in this particular format, that student is very likely to easily develop helpful version control and data management skills.
And in the same vein, when funders require open access publications, then the senior members of a research project will do exactly that.
I'm excited to build the Turing Way to both inspire the people who DO the research to make all their outputs as accessible as possible, and to nudge everyone else in the ecosystem to care about the work required to do so.

### Patricia Herterich

**Who are you?**

I'm the Research Repository Advisor at the University of Birmingham which basically means I support research data management and open research as much as possible and I'm in charge of repository systems (the library kind) to enable this.
From 2012 to 2016, I've worked at CERN as a doctoral student supporting Open Research stuff and still have to finish writing up the results in my PhD thesis and submit to the Humboldt-Universitaet in Berlin but tend to spend the time watching Netflix or crocheing :-(

**What are you passionate about?**

Making the world a better place. I think opening up research is part of that as open access to publications is key to provide knowledge to people who cannot afford subscriptions and going beyond this and sharing code and data has the potential to make research more inclusive and win back trust in experts and scientific results.
I really care about collaborating and get really excited about trying new tools if my limited tech skills allow.
I'd like to have taken down Elsevier by the end of my career. ;-)

**Why do you care about the Turing Way?**

I really think ways of working and reward structures in academia need to change as most discussions around open research end up with "how does that help me with my career". As a librarian, it feels like our influence is often limited, but I try to set up workshops/events to at least get the discussion started and give especially PhD students the feeling that they can challenge the status quo and there will be people in the institution that will support them that might not be their supervisor.
I really love how the Turing Way aims to create good examples and I hope we can develop some ideas and resources that can have a positive impact in changing the current system.

**What are you passionate about?**

*This answer should be whatever you want it to be. It makes sense to say something related to science, but you can go totally broad here! Please aim for <200 words.*

**Why do you care about the Turing Way?**

*This answer can be as detailed as you like, but if you can say something about why you care about this project that would be great! I understand that we're all still building the goals etc, so please use this opportunity to say what you're most passionate about.* :smiley_cat: *Please aim for <200 words.*
