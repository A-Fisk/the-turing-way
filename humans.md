# Who's who on the Turing Way team

This file will give you a little introduction to the various members of the Turing Way development team.

### Kirstie Whitaker

**Who are you?**

I'm a research fellow at the Alan Turing Institute and a senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.
I have a PhD in Neuroscience from the University of California at Berkeley and conducted my postdoctoral research at the University of Cambridge in the Brain Mapping Unit.
I am a Mozilla fellowship (2016) and Fulbright scholarship (2007) alumna.

**What are you passionate about?**

I'm really passionate about the concept of making science "open for all".
I take that to mean we should share all of our outputs - the data, code and protocols that we develop - whether they're "significant" or not.
But it also includes making those outputs FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. I am an advocate for greater diversity in STEM and in data science and particularly passionate about improving the ways we reward collaborative and supportive working.
Finally, I'd like to pivot to having data science project be developed in the open from the beginning and with a decision making governance processs that is inclusive and community-lead.

**Why do you care about the Turing Way?**

I've done a lot of advocacy for changing research culture to make our work more efficient and effective, and I've noticed that we need to address the power structures in academia if we are to truly make research reproducible by default.
For example, if a PhD student's supervisor says to them on the very first day: I want you to use git for version control and to keep your data in this particular format, that student is very likely to easily develop helpful version control and data management skills.
And in the same vein, when funders require open access publications, then the senior members of a research project will do exactly that.
I'm excited to build the Turing Way to both inspire the people who DO the research to make all their outputs as accessible as possible, and to nudge everyone else in the ecosystem to care about the work required to do so.

These answers should be only moderately formal.
Please feel free to use your own voice as you answer them.

**Who are you?**

*This answer is a pretty formal description of who you are and what you do. Please aim for <100 words.*

**What are you passionate about?**

*This answer should be whatever you want it to be. It makes sense to say something related to science, but you can go totally broad here! Please aim for <200 words.*

**Why do you care about the Turing Way?**

*This answer can be as detailed as you like, but if you can say something about why you care about this project that would be great! I understand that we're all still building the goals etc, so please use this opportunity to say what you're most passionate about.* :smiley_cat: *Please aim for <200 words.*
