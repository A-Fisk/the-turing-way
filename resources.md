## Checklists

- DLR markdown checklists: https://rse.dlr.de/01_guidelines.html
- eScience center high level checklist: https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/best_practices/checklist.html
- Software Sustainability Institute guides: https://www.software.ac.uk/guides
- Software Quality Guidelines of CLARIAH: Some really useful overall guidelines. Nice bit of history too. Probably too 
detailed for our purposes but feels like useful reading for background knowledge: https://github.com/CLARIAH/software-quality-guidelines/blob/master/softwareguidelines.pdf
- A Checklist for Reproducibility in Reinforcement Learning: https://gist.github.com/iandanforth/536472cc62a8336a96fa4e8d592c8e3f
