- **Reproducability** By using version control, you never lose previous versions of the software. This also gives you a log of changes and allows you to understand what happened.
- **Backup** Version control is usually pushed to an external a shared server, which immediately provides a backup.
- **Integration** Version control software and host makes it more easy to integrate with other software that support modern software development, such as testing (continuous integration ,automatically run tests, build documentation, check code style, integration with bug-tracker, code review infrastructure, comment on code).
- **Easier to collaborate** Version control makes it easier to work on the same code simultaneously, while everyone still has a well defined version of the software (in contrast to a google-docs or shared file system type of system). Moreover, version control hosting websites such as Github provide way to communicate in a more structed way, such as in code reviews, about commits and about issues.

### Commit messages

Commit messages are the way for other developers to understand changes in the codebase. In case of using GitHub flow model, commit messages can be very short but pull request comments should explain all the changes. It is very important to explain the why behind implementation choices.
