## Communication
We're always around for a chat in our public gitter channel: https://gitter.im/WhitakerLab/the-turing-way

In addition, you can reach the team members through their preferred way of communication:
- Kirstie Whitaker:
- Becky Arnold:
- Sarah Gibson: [sgibson@turing.ac.uk](mailto:sgibson@turing.ac.uk)
- Louise Bowler:
- Patricia Herterich: if you need a quick answer, ping me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/PHerterich)
- Rosie Higman:
- Anna Krystalli:
- Alex Morley:
- Martin O'Reilly

As most team members do not work full time on the Turing Way, it might take some time until your query or contribution is addressed - especially if expert knowledge is needed.

## Project management
### Issues
- Once completed, issues should be closed immediately. By adding closes #issue or [something similar](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in a comment on a pull request, merging the pull request will close the issue automatically.
- The team will have a weekly catch up to go triage on open issues, update the project board and agree on priorities for the next week.

### Pull requests
- Pull requests should be reviewed in a timely manner.
- When reviewing a pull request, please do not use the "request a change" function but comment on the change or make a pull request to the file that should be merged.

## Committments
All The Turing Way team members commit to
- making the implicit explicit by documenting their work
- dedicating time to update contribution guidelines and other core documents needed to facilitate collaboration
- feed back on issues in open source software used throughout the Turing Way by opeing an issue in those open source packages and trying to fix them (including documentation)
