# Contributing to the Turing Way

:tada::balloon::cake: **Welcome to the Turing Way repository!** :cake::balloon::tada:

:dizzy::hatched_chick::sunny: *We're so excited you're here and want to contribute.* :sunny::hatched_chick::dizzy:

The point of this starter kit is to **welcome new users and contributors to the Turing Way community**. We hope that these guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved. If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know through one of the many ways to [get in touch](#get-in-touch).

## Table of contents

Been here before? Already know what you're looking for in this guide? Jump to the following sections:

* [Joining the community](#joining-the-community)
* [Get in touch](#get-in-touch)
* [Contributing through GitHub](#contributing-through-github)
* [Where to start: issue labels](#where-to-start-issue-labels)

## Joining the community

The Turing Way community We therefore require that all contributions **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.

## Get in touch

You can contact the PI of the Turing Way project - Kirstie Whitaker - by email at kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk. 

## Contributing through GitHub

[git][git] is a really useful tool for version control. [GitHub][github] sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

We know that it can be daunting to start using git and GitHub if you haven't worked with them in the past, but the BIDS Starter Kit maintainers are here to help you figure out any of the jargon or confusing instructions you encounter! :heart:

In order to contribute via GitHub you'll need to set up a free account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to help you get going. Remember that you can ask us any questions you need to along the way.

## Writing in markdown

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

Most of the writing that you'll do will be in [Markdown][markdown]. You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting. For example you could write words as bold (`**bold**`), or in italics (`*italics*`), or as a [link][rick-roll] (`[link](https://https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another webpage.

## Where to start: issue labels

The list of labels for current issues can be found [here][turing-way-labels] and includes:

* [![help-wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/-help%20wanted-159818.svg)][labels-helpwanted] *These issues contain a task that a member of the team has determined we need additional help with.*

    If you feel that you can contribute to one of these issues, we especially encourage you to do so!

* [![question](https://img.shields.io/badge/-question-cc317c.svg)][labels-question] *These issues contain a question that you'd like to have answered.*

    There are [lots of ways to ask questions](#get-in-touch) but opening an issue is a great way to start a conversation and get your answer. 

* [![good-first-issue](https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20issue-1b3487.svg)][labels-firstissue] *These issues are particularly appropriate if it is your first contribution to the Turing Way, or to GitHub overall.*

    If you're not sure about how to go about contributing, these are good places to start. You'll be mentored through the process by the maintainers team. If you're a seasoned contributor, please select a different issue to work from and keep these available for the newer and potentially more anxious team members.

* [![Enhancement](https://img.shields.io/badge/-enhancement-84b6eb.svg)][labels-enhancement] *These issues are suggesting new features that can be added to the project.*

    If you want to ask for something new, please try to make sure that your request is distinct from any others that are already in the queue (or part of the Turing Way). If you find one that's similar but there are subtle differences please reference the other enhancement in your issue.

* [![Community](https://img.shields.io/badge/-community-8605c1.svg)][labels-community] *These issues relate to building and supporting the Turing Way community.*

 This is all about collaborating, so please let us know how we can best support you as a community member.
 
* [![Bug](https://img.shields.io/badge/-bug-ee0701.svg)][labels-bug] *These issues are reporting a problem or a mistake in the project.*

    The more details you can provide the better! If you know how to fix the bug, please open an issue first and then submit a pull request :sparkles:

* [![Tools](https://img.shields.io/badge/-tools-a3e07d.svg)[labels-tools]

* [![Travel](https://img.shields.io/badge/-travel-0f42fc.svg)[labels-travel]

* [![Comms](https://img.shields.io/badge/-comms-15c4b2.svg)[labels-comms]

    We like to model best practice, so the Turing Way itself is managed through these issues. We may occasionally have some to coordinate some logistics.
